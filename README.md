# AI4I-2020-Predictive-Maintainance-Dataset
The AI4I 2020 Predictive Maintenance dataset is a crucial asset in the rapidly evolving industrial landscape, featuring 10,000 instances. With a nuanced breakdown of product quality variants (L, M, H), it provides essential insights for comprehending and predicting machinery behavior. Operational metrics such as torque, rotational speed, air temperature, process temperature, and tool wear offer a detailed understanding of machinery states. The dataset's incorporation of diverse machine failure modes—Tool Wear, Heat Dissipation, Power Failure, Overstrain, and Random Failures— mirrors real-world industrial complexities. This project's overarching goal is to employ multiple machine learning techniques on the dataset, unlocking its predictive potential. The dual objectives involve predicting machinery failures and translating these predictions into actionable plans for enhanced operational effectiveness. The ultimate aim is to furnish companies with a proactive maintenance strategy, minimizing downtime, optimizing resource utilization, and cultivating a resilient and efficient industrial ecosystem. The comprehensive nature of the dataset positions it as a vital tool for improving operational reliability and minimizing financial losses in the face of unplanned machinery failures.
